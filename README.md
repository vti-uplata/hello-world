what the fuck am I doing here?

I am totally useless and brainless person. I am in my 30s, and all that i can do perfectly are simple activities as sleep and eat. Can't do any decent bash code or have deep understanding in any IT field. Nor my spoken and written english is good. What the hell am I doing on this planet? What sense has my useless life? I have no illusions such as I am a good person, or I can do something better than others, or I have some kind of knowledge, or talent. Hell no.

In my defence I can say - I didn't ask for this life. I'd prefer to just not exist. It would be so much better for everyone if I ceased to be like I haven't existed. There will be no more disgrace and shame on my mother and sisters.

I don't want to die. I just want to un-exist.
